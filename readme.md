# Hectic Harvest!
## An Apple Catching Game by Josh, Kyra, and Mary Ella

### This is a pretty fun (in our opinion) game made using pygame. The object is to catch apples as they fall - but there are other falling items that can either help or hurt you in your quest.

### The player can be controlled either using the arrow pad or WASD. Hope you enjoy!
